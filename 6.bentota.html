        <br>
        <p id="para1">All visitors to Bentota enjoy visiting the Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project. The picturesque golden sands that entice you to our island also offer numerous endangered turtle species, such the Olive Ridley and Leatherback turtles, an alluring nesting site. The project's objective is to preserve and safeguard the eggs against predators and other threats. To find out more about these beautiful and endangered sea creatures, go to the turtle hatchery in Bentota.<br><br></p>

                <td><h2><u>WHAT HAPPENS AT THE HATCHERY<br></u></h2><p id="para2">Until the eggs hatch and are prepared to swim back home, the turtle hatchery guards the eggs. The group also saves sea turtles who sustain injuries from fishing nets, motors, and other sources while at sea. Before being released back, they are frequently rehabbed.<br>To prevent the extinction of the turtles, the Sri Lankans established the Turtle Hatchery. In the past, people—typically fishermen—would gather turtle eggs and sell them to anybody willing to pay a greater price. These eggs were fed and cared for when the turtle hatchery opened until they were 2 to 4 years old. There are several turtle species, including the Green Turtle, Leatherback, and Olive Ridley. Despite being extinct, fishermen continue to catch turtles for their shells and fish, which is a very lucrative market.</p></td>
