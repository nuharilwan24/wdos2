                    <td><p id="para1">The sea turtle is one of the most fascinating creatures that Sri Lanka is home to because it is one of the world's many endangered species. Sea turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's western coast frequently see a sizable number of them. The sea turtles travel to the hatcheries during their molting cycle by swimming through the vast Indian Ocean. The Galle Sea Turtle Hatchery of Sri Lanka was founded about 40 years ago to safeguard these regular visitors to the Galle Sea shore.<br><br>Brightly colorful turtles are shown in artistic artwork on the exterior walls of this Galle hatchery. Nearby visitor-friendly caution notice boards are located by each tank. Visitors to the hatchery may often watch live demonstrations that depict the whole life cycle of sea turtles, including their phase of conservation. The area acts as a nursery for all the baby sea turtles that first opened their eyes here. The hatchery features a number of little water tanks for the safety of these young sea turtles.</p></td>
